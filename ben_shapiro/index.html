        <p>I've been @ by many SJWs to review the book Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky. And I am appalled to say that it is entirely lacking in capitalist values. In this novel, Raskolnikov commits a series of crimes including violently murdering his landlord and an innocent bystander. Didn't I mention in a previous post that #landlords are essential workers!? Had Raskolnikov - this poor excuse of a member of society - had instead pulled himself up by the bootstraps and put in the effort to better himself he could have escaped his utterly depressing situation. But alas, I have no sympathy for such individuals. Disrespecting and out right murdering his landlord was the last straw and this incident happened worringly early in the novel. On top of that, Raskolnikov tries to validate his own horrid decisions for the betterment of society. Personally, I believe that Raskolnikov should have just stayed in his lane and played the game. Trying to remove yourself from society and become above it is a horrible idea. People who attempt to do this should be utterly shunned and perhaps...reducated. I care for others, and would never want to laugh in the face of those who suffer. But I'm glad that throughout the rest of this miserable novel that he had to deal with the consequences of his crimes when he was finally put in his rightful place: prison. As a pro-life man, I support the death penalty in the regards to Raskolnikov. #ProLife #SupporttheDeathPenalty</p>

        <p>Just finished The Sympathizer and it was worse than transgenderism. Imagine that! Woke professors like Viet Thanh Nguyen attempt time and time again to influence the free-thinking American with THEIR nonsense. This liberal leftist professor threatens the very fabric of American society through the weakest link: sensitive SJW liberals. He attempts to weaken our own minds so we can unknowingly accept communist propaganda like that poor excuse of a book. On top of that, Nyguen attempts to make us overly sensitive towards the racially diverse and immigrants of war. Don't get me wrong, I care about immigrants. But not when they're in my country. Forcing Americans to be sympathetic (very funny, Ngyuen) and subsequently throwing our money, time and support at their cause marginalizes real Amercians. Why should non-Americans who happen to be mixed receive special treatment and power to represent themselves in a society that they are NOT a part of? Instead of reading such a poorly written book, I suggest reading my book &quot;How To Destroy America In Three Easy Steps. #AmericansFirst #Don'tCommunistMyAmerica</p>

        <p>Quite surprised to find that I enjoyed the novel The White Tiger. I was almost convinced that the novel was going to attempt to shove communist and socialist propaganda down my throat. Pleasantly surprised to say that the novel is ALL American despite being written by a non-American. Balram, our protagonist, was born in the lowest rungs of Indian society, but was able to meet success by pulling himself up by the bootstraps. Through enough hard work, elbow grease and sweat (while consistently denouncing the Chinese premier) he could taste the fruits of his labor. He created his own entrepreneurial powerhouse, thus supporting his local economy by providing jobs. As you can see here, there is no reason to be jobless if you work hard enough. Hypothetically, if I were to be unemployed, I wouldn't be because I would simply find a job. It would be such an honor to work under a man such as Balram. Despite all the good of this book, I do have some qualms. Balram's landlords were far under-appreciated. The landlord's served very important roles and should be appreciated for their hard work. As a pro-life and pro-landlord man, I can say <em>#Landlords</em> are essential workers. Today, I am inspired to work harder by building my empire through accumulating wealth in the housing sector. Could have implemented a few more capitalist ideologies, but the fundamental ideas of the novel were solid. Nice job, @AravindAdiga</p>
