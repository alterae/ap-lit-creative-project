        <p>There is no better way to spend a Sunday evening than by loudly reading classic literature to mother in hopes of getting her to pay attention to me. Believe you me, it doesn't always work, but when it does, the pay off is stupendous! This post, as all of mine are, will be centered around my problems with mother, as well as my witty observations about classic literature. Sometimes I feel like this website was created just for me - a website for book reviews and hookups! Who would have thought! Anyways, while I find many characters relatable in the classics, one that I can never wrap my head around is Svidrigailov from Crime and Punishment. Personally, I prefer cougars to the younger women that Svidri likes, but as I have learned in my practice, all of our desires and wants regarding sex come from our childhoods. I predict, in Svidri's case, that his father may have also sought out younger women, and that his mother may not have been present. Thus, he spent much of his life in prison and leeching off of his wife, that is, until he could marry a younger woman. Moreover, he also likes to have power over women, which may have also stemmed from the lack of a maternal figure in his childhood, but I will never be able to fully psychoanalyze and understand him :( Back to the point, this Sunday night may have been my worst in many months. Mother has grown tired of my constant neediness, and has forced me to write this post. So, if anyone out there wants to make love to me, Sigmund Freud, please, please, please DM me. Think of my poor mother!</p>

        <p>I was reading the most fascinating book this morning after mommy and me time. It was about this very troubled young man who felt a certain urge to defile a squid and eat it. Wow! Don't get me wrong, we've all been there, but never in my life have I felt the need to eat it later. Additionally, I never would have thought to save my mother's taste buds from my seed, and this behaviour goes against many of my theories on adolescence's impulses. Despite that, this is a perfect example of the conflicting desires of the super ego and the id. Sexual deviancy is often discordant with the morality that we adopt/are taught within society, which perfectly showcases the cognitive dissonance that so many experience in their day to day lives. The young man touches on this by comparing one's response to masturbation versus murder, and moreover, that people are far more ashamed of their (and other's) sexual desires than immoral actions, but let me tell you, there is nothing to be ashamed of. For example, my mother breastfed me until I was 12 (and I loved every second of it!). Although my postulate is most likely correct, it probably has far more to do with this young man's father's absence during his formative years. Anyways, I'm seeking a young woman, resembling Mother, who is looking for a good time ;)</p>

        <p>Ah, Oedipus. Sophocles, you devilish writer, you genius, you absolute chad! It is not very often that one writes fanfiction in a play format, but I find that an academic mind such as my own is rarely challenged by the posts on Whatsapp. Now, I know that the main theme in Oedipus is fate, but what is more reminiscent of fate than wanting to shtup your mother and toytn your father? It is a normal - nay, inescapable- aspect of the human condition. It is my belief that all sexual deviancy can be linked back to childhood, and Oedipus is a great example! When one's parents abandon them from a young age, they are not properly able to explore the phases of psychosexual development, and may face struggles (like Oedipus!) in their adult lives. Embrace your humanity!!!! For what else are we than these primal urges? Speaking of primal urges, I am in the restroom at Denny's (you know, the one with the glory holes?) if anyone would like to... well, I'll leave that part up to you ;)</p>
