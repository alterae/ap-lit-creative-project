Dostoevsky, and other such abhorrent individuals who may be called existentialists, should be subject to state censorship! Though Dostoevsky does advocate for Christianity in the end of his best-known work, _Crime and Punishment_, there is much left to be desired in the first 500 or so pages both morally and from a reader's perspective. First of all, it is quite astonishing to me that people are capable of writing multiple sentences in a paragraph, and Dostoevsky, though you fared much better than most in terms of prose from a judgemental stant point, I cannot advocate enough for the use of commas (and despite what people may tell you, one can never use to many commas, believe me, it is impossible, and I highly doubt that you could prove me wrong, but, moreover, I posit that a novel is not truly a masterpiece, or even a good book, if the amount of commas in a chapter does not outnumber the stars in the sky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, see,? Isn't my writing utterly, shall I say, brilliant,? ). Aside from this valuable grammar lesson from this literal grammar nazi (Google me! I'm not a racist... I'm a mega-racist!), I have many more thoughts to propose regarding Dostoevsky's propositions and ideas about religion, and though many of them are agreeable and respectable, I do not find it acceptable in the slightest for a character arc to include a spiritual journey, which, nonetheless, leads him to committing many immoral and inexcusable acts, and completely disregarding the categorical imperative. Spiritual rejection, again, has led to various immoral acts and has promoted a careless philosophy regarding human nature. If it were up to me, _Crime and Punishment_ would have only started at the epilogue.
