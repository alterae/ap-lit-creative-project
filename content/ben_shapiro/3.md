I've been @ by many SJWs to review the book Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky. And I am appalled to say that it is entirely lacking in capitalist values. In this novel, Raskolnikov commits a series of crimes including violently murdering his landlord and an innocent bystander. Didn't I mention in a previous post that #landlords are essential workers!? Had Raskolnikov - this poor excuse of a member of society - had instead pulled himself up by the bootstraps and put in the effort to better himself he could have escaped his utterly depressing situation. But alas, I have no sympathy for such individuals. Disrespecting and out right murdering his landlord was the last straw and this incident happened worringly early in the novel. On top of that, Raskolnikov tries to validate his own horrid decisions for the betterment of society. Personally, I believe that Raskolnikov should have just stayed in his lane and played the game. Trying to remove yourself from society and become above it is a horrible idea. People who attempt to do this should be utterly shunned and perhaps...reducated. I care for others, and would never want to laugh in the face of those who suffer. But I'm glad that throughout the rest of this miserable novel that he had to deal with the consequences of his crimes when he was finally put in his rightful place: prison. As a pro-life man, I support the death penalty in the regards to Raskolnikov. #ProLife #SupporttheDeathPenalty
