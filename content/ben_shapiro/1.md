Just finished The Sympathizer and it was worse than transgenderism. Imagine that! Woke professors like Viet Thanh Nguyen attempt time and time again to influence the free-thinking American with THEIR nonsense. This liberal leftist professor threatens the very fabric of American society through the weakest link: sensitive SJW liberals. He attempts to weaken our own minds so we can unknowingly accept communist propaganda like that poor excuse of a book. On top of that, Nyguen attempts to make us overly sensitive towards the racially diverse and immigrants of war. Don't get me wrong, I care about immigrants. But not when they're in my country. Forcing Americans to be sympathetic (very funny, Ngyuen) and subsequently throwing our money, time and support at their cause marginalizes real Amercians. Why should non-Americans who happen to be mixed receive special treatment and power to represent themselves in a society that they are NOT a part of? Instead of reading such a poorly written book, I suggest reading my book "How To Destroy America In Three Easy Steps. #AmericansFirst #Don'tCommunistMyAmerica
