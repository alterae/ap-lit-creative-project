Quite surprised to find that I enjoyed the novel The White Tiger. I was almost convinced that the novel was going to attempt to shove communist and socialist propaganda down my throat. Pleasantly surprised to say that the novel is ALL American despite being written by a non-American. Balram, our protagonist, was born in the lowest rungs of Indian society, but was able to meet success by pulling himself up by the bootstraps. Through enough hard work, elbow grease and sweat (while consistently denouncing the Chinese premier) he could taste the fruits of his labor. He created his own entrepreneurial powerhouse, thus supporting his local economy by providing jobs. As you can see here, there is no reason to be jobless if you work hard enough. Hypothetically, if I were to be unemployed, I wouldn't be because I would simply find a job. It would be such an honor to work under a man such as Balram. Despite all the good of this book, I do have some qualms. Balram's landlords were far under-appreciated. The landlord's served very important roles and should be appreciated for their hard work. As a pro-life and pro-landlord man, I can say _#Landlords_ are essential workers. Today, I am inspired to work harder by building my empire through accumulating wealth in the housing sector. Could have implemented a few more capitalist ideologies, but the fundamental ideas of the novel were solid. Nice job, @AravindAdiga
