Ah, Oedipus. Sophocles, you devilish writer, you genius, you absolute chad! It is not very often that one writes fanfiction in a play format, but I find that an academic mind such as my own is rarely challenged by the posts on Whatsapp. Now, I know that the main theme in Oedipus is fate, but what is more reminiscent of fate than wanting to shtup your mother and toytn your father? It is a normal - nay, inescapable- aspect of the human condition. It is my belief that all sexual deviancy can be linked back to childhood, and Oedipus is a great example! When one's parents abandon them from a young age, they are not properly able to explore the phases of psychosexual development, and may face struggles (like Oedipus!) in their adult lives. Embrace your humanity!!!! For what else are we than these primal urges? Speaking of primal urges, I am in the restroom at Denny's (you know, the one with the glory holes?) if anyone would like to... well, I'll leave that part up to you ;)
