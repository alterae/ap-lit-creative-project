I was reading the most fascinating book this morning after mommy and me time. It was about this very troubled young man who felt a certain urge to defile a squid and eat it. Wow! Don’t get me wrong, we’ve all been there, but never in my life have I felt the need to eat it later. Additionally, I never would have thought to save my mother’s taste buds from my seed, and this behaviour goes against many of my theories on adolescence's impulses. Despite that, this is a perfect example of the conflicting desires of the super ego and the id. Sexual deviancy is often discordant with the morality that we adopt/are taught within society, which perfectly showcases the cognitive dissonance that so many experience in their day to day lives. The young man touches on this by comparing one’s response to masturbatinon versus murder, and moreover, that people are far more ashamed of their (and other’s) sexual desires than immoral actions, but let me tell you, there is nothing to be ashamed of. For example, my mother breastfed me until I was 12 (and I loved every second of it!). Although my postulate is most likely correct, it probably has far more to do with this young man’s father’s absence during his childhood. Anyways, I’m seeking a young woman, resembling Mother, who is looking for a good time ;)
