        <strong>About me: </strong><p>It is through the synthesis of A) a posteriori centered thesis, or rather, if it behooves oneself, empiricism, and B) an a priori centered antithesis found in such philosophical contexts as the works of many contemporary philosophers living in the enlightenment, mayhaps rationalism would best describe the aforementioned antithesis, which together, from the middle ground that my philosophy lives within, in that, morality is a synthetic a priori concept, which is responsible for the phenomenal world as one would experience it, and that the noumenal world, in which humans are incapable of observation and innate experience the true state of the universe, rules out the separation of empiricism and rationalism. In other words, where A) a posteriori concept is concerned in a school of thought, and where B) an a priori concept is concerned in another school of thought, and as for my philosophy, see AB. Simple.</p>

        <p>Nihilism! I would ask what heartless God would let such a concept exist, but then I'd be undermining my own point, wouldn't I? It is my understanding that nihilism, though a close cousin - nay, uncle- of existentialism, can be derived both rationally and empirically from the natural world, and though the method posteriori is not one that I can attest to, the method a priori is in my wheelhouse, and yet, is not understandable. For instance, Nietzsche, who, while perhaps offering some insight regarding the praxis of nihilism, mainly inspected the concept from a rationalist perspective. I too can be a rationalist thinker, though my philosophy includes both rationalism and empiricism, and it is arguable that, as I, a person with a (more than) functional mind cannot come to understand the logic and reasoning behind nihilism, that it is not remotely observable through a purely rational lens, or if it is observable, it is not common sense, and therefore cannot be regarded as a product or theory of rational thought. An example of the empirical side of nihilism would be Joseph Conrad's <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, which retells the story of a man's experiences collecting ivory in the Congo, and was, in a way, autobiographical for Conrad. In the novel, Marlow, the main character, faces &quot;godlessness&quot; and immorality to an extreme extent. In my opinion, though the aforementioned characteristics of the Congo must have certainly been present, and as a mega-racist, I am inclined to believe that the colonization was only helping to bring a sense of morality to the southern hemisphere, though I may be pontificating here, but, as I have previously mentioned on this website, religion and morality are in no way connected, and just because immorality is omnipresent in the Congo, that does not mean that God does not exist or that life is meaningless, but rather that humanity strayed from the categorical imperative and presented itself in such a manner in which &quot;godlessness&quot; could be ignorantly and arrogantly perceived. Thus, it is my conclusion that nihilism is not observable in the universe or understandable, so it must be that immorality is the cause of spiritual rejection in such schools of thought or novels.</p>

        <p>Some such philosophical schools of thought and ideas emerging after the enlightenment, or rather, humanity's peak, are, quite bluntly, dangerous and are taking us back to the dark ages. As is normal, this correlation can be tied directly to the French, as it is often them to whom the responsibility of turning the Earth into an inferno and outright hellscape is repeatedly attributed. Well I have, in the past, been an ardent supporter in the French revolutionary cause, as my later works discuss, I do not stand for the &quot;intellectual&quot; revolution that has been emerging due to, most prominently, existentialism and absurdism. While existentialism still regards the human need for meaning, and moreover, the need for morality and a common understanding of what we <em>ought</em> to do and our responsibilities towards one another, absurdism completely dismisses these aforementioned necessities for humanity to function on a morally good level, and instead, the negligence and ignorance of this philosophy excuses disgusting behaviour in exchange for the idea that all is meaningless. The worst culprit of this that I have come across is Albert Camus, and his philoso-novel (poor, pathetic Frenchmen, unable to prove a point through philosophy alone, so they must illustrate their thoughts through the likes of fiction- disgusting!), <em>The Stranger</em>. In many scenes, Meursault, the main character of this disgrace, commits heinous acts against humanity and practically denounces religion, and by practically, it is better for the reader to interpret his actions (assaulting and screaming at a priest) as his position on religion. While religion and morality are not tied together, as I believe that humanity is composed of autonomous individuals who are not tethered to morality by the likes of a God, and, in turn, are capable of having free will, though we still ought to act morally and take into account the categorical imperative. In Camus' novel, if I may use such a word to describe this atrocity, Meursault is a stranger to both the mores and values that a society is constructed on, and especially, their entwinement with God. Spiritual rejection, though spirituality and religion are very separate entities as I have previously mentioned, does impact morality in the same way in that adopting customs other than those built from the tenets posed by God, moreover, a western God, is threatening and incredibly dangerous to society at large. (Google me! I'm not a racistâ€¦ I'm a mega-racist!). As you French like to say, one's <em>raison d'etre</em> may not be innately obvious to humanity, but I posit that it is far worse to reject the principles of Christianity and the meaning it poses, than to live with no direction in life and moral compass.</p>

        <p>Dostoevsky, and other such abhorrent individuals who may be called existentialists, should be subject to state censorship! Though Dostoevsky does advocate for Christianity in the end of his best-known work, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, there is much left to be desired in the first 500 or so pages both morally and from a reader's perspective. First of all, it is quite astonishing to me that people are capable of writing multiple sentences in a paragraph, and Dostoevsky, though you fared much better than most in terms of prose from a judgemental stant point, I cannot advocate enough for the use of commas (and despite what people may tell you, one can never use to many commas, believe me, it is impossible, and I highly doubt that you could prove me wrong, but, moreover, I posit that a novel is not truly a masterpiece, or even a good book, if the amount of commas in a chapter does not outnumber the stars in the sky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, see,? Isn't my writing utterly, shall I say, brilliant,? ). Aside from this valuable grammar lesson from this literal grammar nazi (Google me! I'm not a racist... I'm a mega-racist!), I have many more thoughts to propose regarding Dostoevsky's propositions and ideas about religion, and though many of them are agreeable and respectable, I do not find it acceptable in the slightest for a character arc to include a spiritual journey, which, nonetheless, leads him to committing many immoral and inexcusable acts, and completely disregarding the categorical imperative. Spiritual rejection, again, has led to various immoral acts and has promoted a careless philosophy regarding human nature. If it were up to me, <em>Crime and Punishment</em> would have only started at the epilogue.</p>
